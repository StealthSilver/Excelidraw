Excelidraw is a colloborative canvas app wher you can create diagrams with the help of the tools that are provided.

Stpes for the project 

1. npm install -g pnpm 
pnpm is another package manager like npm, bun, yarn. 

pnpm is better than npm.
facebook intoduced yarn for getting rid of central dependencies as the node modules take too much space.

2. initialize a new turborepo (monorepo)
npx create-turbo@latest
use pnpm as package manager

3. go in the draw-app directory and run 
a. pnpm install 
b. pnpm run dev

4. as for excelidraw we just need a single frontend, delete the docs frontend and keep the web one

IDEAL WAY (test driven development): first write the tests -> then write the backend -> then write the frontend 

5. create two backend repos. http-server, ws-backend

the tests are written in packages
this is the boiler plate for the application

6. initialize the package.json in both the backends
npm init -y

7. initialize the tsconfig, there is already a base typescript config in the packages, extend it in the backends
add the base typscript config in both the backends

for npm use *, for pnpm use workspace:*
add the dependency in for the ts-config in the package.json
* better to add as a devDependency as it is only required with the dev time

8. go to the root folder and do a pnpm install again

9. adding a build, dev and start script to both the projects
